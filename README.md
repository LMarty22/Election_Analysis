# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

In the election audit Tom and Seth are looking for assistance in analyzing all election ballots received. The data has been collected and it is ready to be reviewed and processed with the goal in mind find the total number of all votes collected, identify all candidates who received votes and ultimately the winner, along with the total amount of votes received and percentage victory over other candidates. To further analyze the election data, Tom and Seth have inquired to for further analysis on a county level. Votes are tallied up to represent the total number of votes received in each county, to demonstrate which counties had the largest voter turnout in the election.

*It was determined that there was a total of three candidates voters voted for; Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymond Anthony. Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 total votes equivalent to roughly 74% of total voter turnout.

## Election - Audit Summary

For this particular election it has been determined that Diana DeGette hold victory as the new elected official. For future reoccurring data analysis of election ballots one can review data using current Python programming by making slight modification. First modification which must be done is to identify the file storing the new data set, and modify the current command to pull from this particular file. This will ensure that programming/coding will be done in the appropriate data file.  All other modifications which will need to be completed will be based on the raw data analysis/review. Correctly cleaning up the data and identifying which columns and rows the data is stored in will dictate any future command modifications which will need to be made. Depending on how data is arranged in the new data file, rows may need to be adjusted as well as the columns from which programming will be pulled. Depending on the size of the data file, some changed may need to be made to refactor data in order to keep the analysis output time efficient.
